Feature: Accordian feature
	As a content editor I am able to add 
	edit and delete the accordian component
	on existing and newly created pages


Scenario: Validate that horizontal rows with text aligned to the left can be expanded.
	Given I add accordian in the page editor 
	And I have entered 70 into the calculator
	When I press add
	Then the result should be 120 on the screen


Scenario: Validate Once clicked on there should be an area for content, a rich text area to add informational text.

Scenario: Validate Once clicked again in the horizontal row will detract and go back to just a full width row with the title text.
